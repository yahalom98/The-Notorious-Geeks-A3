                            <p class='introductionP'>My name is Omer Yahalom, 22 years old from Israel. I currently study at RMIT University through OUA and my student number is s3858332. Currently, I live in Israel as it is my hometown but I used to live in several places like
                                Germany and Poland. I speak English and Hebrew and I am an aspiring Polish learner. Today I am working as a freelancer for a cybersecurity company called Tufin as a front-end developer. I used to work in several companies
                                until I decided I want to become a freelancer because of the freedom and interesting people you meet along the way. I usually like to build websites, web applications, and mobile applications. I am in love with cooking,
                                watching documentary movies, and taking photos in my free time when I am not coding. The name we choose for the team is The Notorious Geeks.

                            <p class='introductionP'> My name is Ali Hammoud, 28 years old from Sydney, Australia. My student number is s3798721. I am currently working as a sales professional in the IT industry, but my road to get there was not quite direct. I had an interest
                                in computers from a young age, and I was always the go-to IT person in our circle of family and friends. I studied a few semesters of Architecture and Computer Science, before leaving uni to work as a Jr .NET Developer.
                                I worked in development for a few years before transitioning into an IT focussed sales position. I now have returned to my studies several years later with a renewed motivation to complete my degree here at RMIT. I am hoping
                                to develop both personally and professionally, and it all starts here in the Introduction to IT subject, as part of The Notorious Geeks.</p>

                            <p class='introductionP'> My name is Troy Glossop, I am 45 years old and live in Perth, Western Australia. I currently study full time at RMIT via OUA and my student number is s3572875. I have a background in I.T. and have worked in the industry since
                                1998, where my first role was as a technician building PCs for a large Computer store. In 1999, the store I worked at launched its own ISP, and as I had extensive experience with Unix and Linux, I became a System Administrator.
                                This is the role I usually worked in until 2014 where I had to leave the industry due to health reasons. I am very interested in many facets of I.T, many of my hobbies are impossible without knowledge of Computers. My hobbies
                                include playing music with my friends, building FPV Drones, playing Fighting Games competitively, Sim Racing and adoring my 20-year-old cat “Little Cat”. Our team name is “the Notorious Geeks”.</p>

                            <h3><a href=""><b>Mohamed Abdirashid Ali</b> </a></h3>
                            <p class='introductionP'>My name is Mohamed Abdirashid, I am of Somali descent and was born in Nairobi, Kenya. In 1998 my family and I migrated to Adelaide, South Australia where I lived for several years, before relocating to Melbourne where my mom
                                opened up a successful furniture store. I come from a big family of seven siblings; four brothers and three sisters, and I’m a proud uncle to three girls and one boy. In the family household I speak either English or Somali.
                                I am an enthusiastic foodie and enjoy traveling, exercise and experiencing different cuisines as hobbies. In 2020 I began my studies as an OUA student through RMIT studying both Introduction to Information Technology and
                                Introduction to Programming, my student number being s3450966. I am new to the IT industry, however from a young age, I have always had a keen interest in Technology and Computers. In particular through my career as a Security
                                Supervisor I have developed the keen interest of protecting, preventing and monitoring systems in the physical world. I plan on integrating these skills into the cyber world as a Cyber Security Analyst in the near future.
                                Since starting my studies in March, I have learnt many aspects of IT such as Cloud computing, self-driving cars, ethics and laws within the industry, E-wallets and much more. Now as a member of the Notorious Geeks, I am
                                very excited to interact with like-minded individuals and look forward to learning and exploring more topics and techniques in the IT industry through our group assignment.

                        <p>In assignment 3 there was a change in the tool utilised for collaboration as zoom had limited meeting time, there was a shift to teams in assignment 3. In assignment 2 and in accordance to the Myers-Briggs test, our group displayed
                            a balanced dynamic that brought different qualities to the team that benefited everyone. Ali’s personality type (Mediator) allowed him to be inspired by ideas rather than logic and analytics, and it often allowed him to be
                            a bridge between different ideas and perspectives. Omer (Advocate) complements Ali’s personality type quite well in that he has large ambitions and ideas and is also led by morality. He can also see the practical steps to get
                            there. He is inspired by morality and idealism and can easily get to the heart of an issue. Troy (Architect) has a profession for analytics that can be used to gather data and ensure the rest of the group has all the information
                            needed to make decisions. Architects are great at design and implementing effective plans. Mohamed (Protagonist) brings everything together by being a natural-born leader and can bring out the best in everyone and make sure
                            they have what they need. Each of us has different learning styles, which means we can bounce ideas off of each other and make sure none of us gets left behind. Information can be displayed in different ways and from different
                            perspectives, and this is an extremely healthy way to learn. These qualities manifested within the team during assignment 2. In contrast every individual within the group has weaknesses according to Myers Brigg personality
                            test and although such weaknesses were not manifested throughout assignment 2 these weaknesses can develop into conflict situations. As underlined in the table below here are the groups weaknesses based on the Myers Brigg personality
                            test.

                    <p>Conflict generally arises due to disagreements such as values, inspirations, ideas, or even desires. A conflict situation may arise within the group due to some of these differences. One way to overcome conflict is through communication
                        and looking towards similarities rather than focusing on differences. Another way conflict may arise is by speaking over, ridiculing those with opposing views rather than being empathetic and having a discussion. Overall, our group
                        is incredibly balanced, and our skills complement each other in many ways. We are aware and thoughtful of each other's differences and each individual brings something different to the table our styles get along which allows us
                        to collaborate effectively despite our weaknesses. </p>

                    <p>Our group all have very different ideal jobs and goals. They vary both in their scope and in their technical focus. Ali’s role, product manager, focuses more on the management of teams and the direction of products. Technical understanding
                        is important, but communication skills are more important for this particular role. Omer’s role as a senior front-end engineer is in very high demand and is a classic skillset in the development world. It is an essential role in
                        bringing many only platforms to life. Troy’s ideal role as a firmware/hardware engineer ventures into the role of actual hardware, which introduces a new dynamic and requires a completely different skillset. Finally, Mohamed’s
                        role as a security analyst requires a keen and devious mind, as well as the technical skills to back it up to defend systems against potential adversaries.</p>

                        <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
                        <p> We have been using Microsoft Teams for meetings as we decided during Assignment 2 that Zoom was very limiting and possibly hindering our workflow. While there are many functionalities we are not utilising, we are finding it assists
                            us greatly in our meets and collaboration. We also store some shared documents on our Teams channel, which is a great “one-stop-shop” if you need to quickly check the Rubric of assignment 3 and don’t have a browser open (For
                            example).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Google Docs</h3>
                        <p>Initially we wanted to move away from Google Docs and use Word integration for Microsoft Teams, however we discovered we were really trying to replace Google Docs with something else that had the exact same functionality. Therefore,
                            we decided to stick with Google Docs as it works perfectly for our needs. While Microsoft Teams is extremely useful to have, the ease of access Google Docs Web interface presents is irreplaceable for our needs.</p>

                        <h3>WhatsApp</h3>
                        <p>We used WhatsApp much less than in previous Assignments. Although we have used it for meetings when one of our members is unable to get to a PC, we mainly use it for quick status updates and “heads up” messages so we are all aware
                            of everyone’s status and current tasks.</p>

                        <h3>Audit Trail</h3>
                        <p>Our Audit trail does not reflect the contribution of our team members, we have been using Google Docs as a platform to collaborate on shared Documents, and then uploading the completed Documents to our Github.</p>

                        <p>We aim to provide accessibility and growth development in order to help people to find nearest toilets and companies to sell their products in a refreshing way. On the other hand, our goal is to reach millions of people and companies
                            by bringing easy to use applications that are understandable and user-friendly. Eventually we want to revolutionize the usage of toilets and the way companies sell their products.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class=''>Plans and Progress:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Flusha is one of a kind application in terms of accessibility and affiliate-marketing. Our application is a mobile app that gives information of nearby free to use toilets based on smart algorithms and community support.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Planning - </b>Since our application is based on accessibility and affiliate-marketing we ought to look at two parameters, how to make our app more informative and easy-use and how to connect smart sales with toilets. We
                            brainstormed about what we should offer to the users and we decided to go to an existing market that has a lot of competition but still wanted to innovate and enhance the way we see and use toilets.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Wireframing - </b> The next thing we have done is to plan the back bones of our application.Wireframing was crucial yet tough to perform and to understand because we needed something that eventually will be usable, simple,
                            beautiful and understandable.First we draw on a piece of paper what is going to be the structure of the application, the main pages included pages like login page, home page, search and recommendations. We planned the positions
                            of each button and image till the small detail as much as we could.We used several types of wireframing softwares like Figma, Wireframe.co and Photoshop but at the end we decided to go with PhotoshopCS6 and IllustratorCS6.
                            The process of converting a drawing to Photoshop was quite hard, nor difficult because everything had to be precise with our idea. We were trying to be collaborative and efficient as much as we can and after several attempts
                            of designing the mockup the outcome was productive, we came with a first translation of our idea and then we all really understood how we were going to develop our application.



                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Development -</b> The development stage has not been made yet due to limited time scopes but we are planning to execute a solid development approach within the 2nd year of this program. To simplify the application, we would
                            use a major and enhanced development framework, React Native which enables us to create cross-platform development without handling difficult technical issues like platform development, user experience and relevance. React
                            Native gives us the possibility to create a functional product using built-in tools, community support, enriching courses and easy path to learn and it focuses on the frontend side of the application. For the backend we would
                            use NodeJS which also gives us full support from the learning path, understandable documentation and community support. NodeJS and React Native make it possible, by creating user-friendly interfaces, connectivity to the backend
                            side and building unique APIs for further app growth.

                        <p>
                            <b>Development Cycle -  </b>We envision a 3 tier Development cycle, namely “Dev”, “Staging” and “Live”. The “Dev” or “Development” cycle and platform is the first stage. It is in heavy construction and not ready for any external
                            functionality. You can think of it as a “pre-Alpha” state. The “Staging” cycle can be considered analogous to late Alpha, transitioning to Beta. Late in this cycle the product should be considered ready for testing but not
                            ready for any external customers. This is where you have the important functionality completed but expect issues to arise. After refining and testing the product it should be ready to go live. “Live” is the product as it is
                            intended to be released to the public. After passing through Dev and Staging cycles, it is expected to be a complete and customer ready product. Utilising the existing IP address filtering functionality in CentOS we can control
                            connections to the live Node.JS instance via an IP pool. This allows us to control exactly who can connect to the instance while it is in Development and Staging, therefore utilizing AWS as a development environment. The benefits
                            of utilising AWS as a development platform are Twofold. AWS is accessible globally, so if we have robust security measures in place, the development environment can be accessed by our team anywhere. This is especially desirable
                            in 2020 as many people are working from home. We do not have to maintain multiple servers for Development, Staging and Live. The product can be developed on the same server and iterated through Development, Staging and Live
                            cycles without the need to migrate to any other servers. This saves unforeseen configuration issues which can arise from mismatched versions, network configuration and hardware mismatches, and this saves time (which is an expense).
                            Once this instance is available, and basic backend functionality is completed, the Front-end Developer, iOS Developer and Android Developer can start on their respective customer interfaces. The Web front end development will
                            take place on the CentOS instance, while the iOS and Android development cycles will take place on the respective workstations of these Developers. Utilising the built-in emulation facilities in Eclipse and XCode, the iOS and
                            Android Developers will be able to iterate from Development to Staging cycles before trialling on the end point hardware (Android and iOS based handsets respectively).

                        <p>
                            <b>Enhancing User Experience and Accessibility -</b> As we defined in our aims and goals of this project, user experience and accessibility is one of our foundations for this product. In order to understand consumers and companies
                            we would need to understand better how they use it in real time and get insight on what can we do better within the usage of the app. We will present the idea and vision of our company and how we can solve a better toilet finding
                            yet enhance sales conversions within the same use. We would present the designed app and ask if they can understand how it might work and eventually do our homework based on relevant feedback. In addition, after we got the
                            information we need to approach a better user experience and we will use softwares like Axure and Adobe XD in order to insure we will have not only a design to show our clients but a proof of concept (POC) and how everything
                            should work after the development stage. We will implement animations, enhanced typography and colors for accessibility and easy to use user experience paths so that people can understand how to use the app within the first
                            time they download it.

                            <b>Behind the idea of Flusha -</b> As young entrepreneurs, we want to change the world, innovate and solve problems that we think can enhance humanity. Everything began right after Ali, Omer, Troy and Mohammed discussed a project
                            for the second assignment we were assigned. It took us weeks to come up with a revolutionizing idea that can potentially help hundreds of millions of consumers. At first, we thought the idea was silly and unhelpful. Although
                            it was silly, we continued with that train of thought and came to realise we may be onto something that is genuinely helpful. We feel we differentiate ourselves from similar applications due to the decisions we have made in
                            the aspects of engineering, design and business development. We progressed with our idea and currently we are working on the UI/UX which might take us a couple of months to finalize before we get feedback from other designers
                            and UX consultants. Afterwards we plan to develop an MVP in order to reach out investors and expand our idea further.

                            </br>
                            <b>Backend Developer</b> The Backend Developer will ideally have Sys Admin and/or Full Stack Development experience, and a skillset that will enable them to configure the AWS server instance and the infrastructure therein,
                            such as Node.JS and MySQL. This is a specific role because the skillset required to complete these task are very specific and while the other
                            </br>
                            <b>Frontend Developer</b> The Frontend Developer will have a strong background in Node.JS and Javascript, and be able to develop a responsive and professional Web front end to the Flusha platform.
                            </br>
                            <b>Android Developer</b> The Android Developer will be experienced in the industry, and have experience working on projects from conception all the way to post release support.
                            </br>
                            <b>iOS Developer</b> The iOS Developer (similar to the Android developer) will be well versed in developing iOS applications to a high standard from conception to post release support.



                        </p>
                        <b>Scope and Limits:</b>
                        </br>
                        <p>Our aim as a team is to create a community and user experience that provides as much value as possible. The goal is often an “MVP” - minimum viable product. This will certainly be our goal when it comes to approaching investors.
                            But when it comes to market, we want to create a minimum valuable product. This means releasing something not when it’s ready to be used, but when it’s ready to create a memorable and valuable experience for our customers.
                            The application has a few moving pieces, so it is important to be precise but not overly rigid in our approach, as things can change. The application has 3 main parts, each of which has minimum required features, listed below.</p>

                        <p>The hardware requirements for the Backend Developer are very minimal, as with many Developers all that is required is a modern workstation with a suitable set of applications. A Linux based Operating System is not essential, but
                            a very suitable choice for the initial configuration and administration of a Linux based Application Server. Many of the required tools such as an IDE (Vim with syntax highlighting), SSH Client, Remote Desktop Client (Remmina)
                            are bundled with Ubuntu and are ready to work straight “out of the box”. Many applications are available via APT, the Ubuntu packaging system and are covered by GPL/GNU or Open Source Software Agreements, and free to use for
                            commercial purposes.

                        <h3>Testing</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>There will be various types of testing we will incorporate into our development. We plan on incorporating standard software testing methodologies into our development cycles. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system
                            testing, and acceptance testing. Success is measured based on passing each of the test cases. It will be the responsibility of the team to build and expand on each stage of testing as we develop the product, listing test cases
                            and corner cases as we go. Testing will be both programmatic and manual. We will conduct manual user testing in-house, inviting friends, family, and people we know to be part of our testing, and compensate them with a free
                            lunch. We can leverage services like UpWork to find manual testers overseas for $10-$15/hour. We would be able to build a cost effective team of around 5 testers based in Asia for timezone purposes. We will not need the testers
                            full-time, but when we do require them it will be in short bursts of high volume testing. These testers would ideally have experience manual testing and using tools such as Jira. As we begin to rollout the product, we will
                            begin with an open beta in a localized area, such as the Melbourne CBD. To ensure we can deal with a large volume of users, we will be conducting load testing on our application and servers. Although there is a risk in deploying
                            an app such as Flusha in a high volume area, a large community is essential to the operation of the app.

    <h3>Risks:</h3>
    <p>The software tools we are using for the project are relatively easy to use and straightforward as far as the engineering is concerned. Our main risks come in 2 forms. One is the effect of a large number of users and ensuring our servers and architecture
        can handle the scale and growth. This is somewhat a generic risk to any marketplace or gig application, and is not something specific to Flusha. Another risk comes in the form of the potential negative impact our application can have on businesses.
        We have a rating system, so there is the risk that users will naturally go to bathrooms with the highest cleanliness ratings. This can affect businesses in multiple ways. Firstly, there is the impact of increased foot traffic and wait times outside
        bathrooms, with establishments having people use bathrooms who may not necessarily be customers. This creates unnecessary congestion in businesses. The other risk is bathrooms with “lower” ratings creating a negative perception of those businesses
        and potentially deterring business.


    </p>
    </br>
    <h3>Group Processes and Communications:</h3>
    <p>All team members will use Teams and Email to communicate non-urgent information, as it is an easy way to share documents and discuss issues that are not urgent enough to demand a face to face meeting or interrupting your work. During a normal work
        week, we will have weekly meetings, for an hour after lunch on Tuesdays. This will be face to face if possible, however Video or Voice chat is acceptable, due to the possibility of team members working remotely. All team members will in turn discuss
        their current action items and any outstanding issues that may warrant a discussion. These meetings may go longer if needed, during the early stages it might be useful to have longer meetings to make sure everyone knows what all team members are
        doing and so everyone is “on the same page”. During periods of heavy activity, it may be warranted to have longer or additional meetings, however these should be focused on action items and as brief as possible. With such a small team, we will
        focus on being adaptable and make sure we are always available to other team members on voice (Teams) or text (email and Teams) if possible.

        <p>What worked well in the group is how well the team was able to collaborate effectively and the time and effort put into the presentation of the application. The group learned from previous assignments and adapted to a more suitable platform for
            collaborating information. We went from utilising zoom to Microsoft teams. This allowed the team to increase in efficiency and collaborate for longer periods without the subtle interruption. In this assignment I have noticed everyone had a
            common trait, everyone was not only willing but sacrificed their personal time working late to get things done. This trait was a surprise because it was not only found in a single individual but throughout the team. What had caught me aback
            in this assignment is the details required to complete sections of the assignment that were perhaps overlooked in the first two or three meetings we had. I would say after trial and error from assignment 1 to assignment 2 there were not many
            aspects to improve except perhaps to utilise more tools and find more innovative ways to reach out to consumers as innovation is something that has no bounds. I have learnt throughout assignment 2 and 3 how important it is to work as a team
            in group settings and communication being a key component for groups to work.

        <h3>Ali Reflection:</h3>
        <p>The north star of our team was our open and free-flowing communication. Different tools enable different types of communication. We opted to using WhatsApp as our “main” communication and Microsoft teams as our more formal platform for posting
            documents and critical information. WhatsApp enabled us to easily coordinate and exchange ideas. It was unexpected to see the team’s balance of egos. That is, we quickly recognised great ideas for what they were, and the team as a whole was
            happy to adopt them. It was very much a meritocracy. Our ease of communication made up for the fact that our project management management skills were lacking. This is definitely an area of improvement. We were good at delegating tasks and
            knowing who was doing what - and this could work well in a small team working on a small project. However, if we are trying to build a product and a business, this process is not scalable. We need to incorporate project management tools into
            our workflows. Our work is mostly recorded in our conversations over teams and WhatsApp. Although we didn’t have a formal log, our conversations reflect our activity well in that there is a clear delegation of tasks as well as consistent and
            practical conversations throughout the project process. After going through this process with the group, I have a newfound appreciation for when people say “communication and planning” are key. When you are working solo, you have all the information
            in your head and can make decisions based on that information. When you work in a group, your team does not know what you are thinking unless you tell them. Therefore, it is essential to communicate your thoughts and ideas so everyone can
            act on that information accordingly.

        <p>In my opinion, this assignment went smoothly only because of the perfect collaboration and outstanding teamwork. Everything was efficient, even the hard parts we struggled to handle. In this assignment I have a true sense that we became stronger
            in aspects of leadership, getting inside time and role scopes, and definitely the communication strategies. Furthermore, this assignment was quite similar and different in a lot of ways from previous assignments, putting more of our opinion,
            vision, and motivation for our mobile app was quite refreshing. The surprising thing was how collaborative we were even after the second assignment. Personally I learned and gained knowledge from this assignment. We used various types of communication
            tools such as Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp different from Assignment 2 that we also used Zoom but we realized it was not sufficient for our team and for this assignment. In addition to that, I might suggest different management approaches like
            Agile using tools like Trello that we can 100% track and solve our assignment faster and make it much more efficient. The overall work was amazing and as I mentioned in all of my feedback I would definitely like to work with this team in the
            near future.

        <h3>Troy Reflection:</h3>
        <p>I feel everything went well during this assignment, we all pulled together as a team and worked towards common goals, just like we did in the previous assignment. I feel that we could have improved our workflow, however, it is surprisingly difficult
            to coordinate a group assignment with members from both sides of Australia and the World, especially when we all have responsibilities outside of study. We did improve upon our methodology from Assignment 2, however there is always room for
            improvement and gains to be made. I found it surprising how well we work together, even after the small break in between finishing Assignment 2 and starting on Assignment 3. We adapted to the new workflow, and while we had some minor teething
            problems, we soon hit the ground running. I learned that everyone in the group is very capable and often has hidden skills that we did not know about. Being much older and having lots of industry experience, I expected to be the team member
            with most knowledge in most areas, but this was not always the case. I really respect my fellow team members and enjoy working with them greatly.</p>

        <h2>Group Reflection:</h2>
        <b>What went well? 
            </b>
        <p>All the active members of the Notorious Geeks feel that everything went very well. Our communications have improved since we moved away from Zoom to Teams for meetings, and the ability to store documents and notes on Teams and have them accessible
            for all, has helped our productivity greatly. We still use WhatsApp for quick updates, and that works well for us, for example, if someone is going to be late to a meeting because of an unforeseen responsibility they can quickly update the
            group from their Mobile. All four members of the Notorious Geeks have confirmed they feel we have become a “well oiled machine” and are very capable of any task that is asked of us.</p>

        <b>What could be improved?
        </b>
        <p>We discovered during the first group assignment (Assignment #2) that our communication methods (Zoom in this case) were not suitable for our needs and made changes to move over to Microsoft Teams. While we utilise some of Teams functionality for
            Voice meetings and sharing documents, we all agree we could have spent more time learning its advanced features, such as the GitHub bot and Word integration. We decided we were happy to use some of its basic features, but agree we could have
            improved our workflow if we were able to utilise some of its more advanced features.</p>

        <b>What was surprising?
        </b>
        <p>We found that it was very surprising how much time can be spent on the small details. For this assignment we found we had to be more agile and able to react quickly when a team members workload is discovered to be greater than anticipated prior
            to starting it. For example, the team member responsible for the Tools and Technology section had determined it would not take a great about of time, as they have lots of personal experience in this field, however it still was very time consuming
            and another team member graciously picked up some task from their “To-do list” so they were able to complete it to the high standard that we expect from each other.</p>

        <b>What have you learned about Groups?
        </b>
        <p>We have all relied on each other much more during this assignment, as we now have worked together for a substantial amount of time. When there were personal issues that arose, we were more able to articulate our needs and work together to make
            sure our group work was not impacted, without feeling anxious or bad about the situation. We feel we really have become a team and enjoy working together greatly.</p>
