                            <p class='introductionP'>My name is Omer Yahalom, 22 years old from Israel. I currently study at RMIT University through OUA and my student number is s3858332. Currently, I live in Israel as it is my hometown but I used to live in several places like
                                Germany and Poland. I speak English and Hebrew and I am an aspiring Polish learner. Today I am working as a freelancer for a cybersecurity company called Tufin as a front-end developer. I used to work in several companies
                                until I decided I want to become a freelancer because of the freedom and interesting people you meet along the way. I usually like to build websites, web applications, and mobile applications. I am in love with cooking,
                                watching documentary movies, and taking photos in my free time when I am not coding. The name we choose for the team is The Notorious Geeks.

                            <p class='introductionP'> My name is Ali Hammoud, 28 years old from Sydney, Australia. My student number is s3798721. I am currently working as a sales professional in the IT industry, but my road to get there was not quite direct. I had an interest
                                in computers from a young age, and I was always the go-to IT person in our circle of family and friends. I studied a few semesters of Architecture and Computer Science, before leaving uni to work as a Jr .NET Developer.
                                I worked in development for a few years before transitioning into an IT focussed sales position. I now have returned to my studies several years later with a renewed motivation to complete my degree here at RMIT. I am hoping
                                to develop both personally and professionally, and it all starts here in the Introduction to IT subject, as part of The Notorious Geeks.</p>

                            <p class='introductionP'> My name is Troy Glossop, I am 45 years old and live in Perth, Western Australia. I currently study full time at RMIT via OUA and my student number is s3572875. I have a background in I.T. and have worked in the industry since
                                1998, where my first role was as a technician building PCs for a large Computer store. In 1999, the store I worked at launched its own ISP, and as I had extensive experience with Unix and Linux, I became a System Administrator.
                                This is the role I usually worked in until 2014 where I had to leave the industry due to health reasons. I am very interested in many facets of I.T, many of my hobbies are impossible without knowledge of Computers. My hobbies
                                include playing music with my friends, building FPV Drones, playing Fighting Games competitively, Sim Racing and adoring my 20-year-old cat “Little Cat”. Our team name is “the Notorious Geeks”.</p>

                            <h3><a href=""><b>Mohamed Abdirashid Ali</b> </a></h3>
                            <p class='introductionP'>My name is Mohamed Abdirashid, I am of Somali descent and was born in Nairobi, Kenya. In 1998 my family and I migrated to Adelaide, South Australia where I lived for several years, before relocating to Melbourne where my mom
                                opened up a successful furniture store. I come from a big family of seven siblings; four brothers and three sisters, and I’m a proud uncle to three girls and one boy. In the family household I speak either English or Somali.
                                I am an enthusiastic foodie and enjoy traveling, exercise and experiencing different cuisines as hobbies. In 2020 I began my studies as an OUA student through RMIT studying both Introduction to Information Technology and
                                Introduction to Programming, my student number being s3450966. I am new to the IT industry, however from a young age, I have always had a keen interest in Technology and Computers. In particular through my career as a Security
                                Supervisor I have developed the keen interest of protecting, preventing and monitoring systems in the physical world. I plan on integrating these skills into the cyber world as a Cyber Security Analyst in the near future.
                                Since starting my studies in March, I have learnt many aspects of IT such as Cloud computing, self-driving cars, ethics and laws within the industry, E-wallets and much more. Now as a member of the Notorious Geeks, I am
                                very excited to interact with like-minded individuals and look forward to learning and exploring more topics and techniques in the IT industry through our group assignment.

                        <h4 class='margin-top'>Team Dynamics</h4>
                        <p>According to the Myers-Briggs test, our group has a balanced dynamic and everyone brings different qualities to the team that benefit everyone. Ali’s personality type (Mediator) allows him to be inspired by ideas rather than logic
                            and analytics, and it often allows him to be a bridge between different ideas and perspectives. Omer (Advocate) complements Ali’s personality type quite well in that he has large ambitions and ideas and is also led by morality.
                            He can also see the practical steps to get there. He is inspired by morality and idealism, and can easily get to the heart of an issue. Troy (Architect) has a profession for analytics that can be used to gather data and ensure
                            the rest of the group has all the information we need to make decisions. Architect’s are great at design and implementing effective plans. Mohamed (Protagonist) brings everything together by being a natural-born leader and
                            is able to bring out the best in everyone and make sure they have what they need. Each of us has different learning styles, which means we can bounce ideas off of each other and make sure none of us gets left behind. Information
                            can be displayed in different ways and from different perspectives, and this is a very healthy way to learn. Overall, our group is incredibly balanced and our skills complement each other. We each bring something different
                            to the table, but our styles get along and we are able to collaborate effectively.

                        </p>

                        <h4 class='margin-top'>Ideal Job Comparison:</h4>
                        <p>Our group all have very different ideal jobs and goals. They vary both in their scope and in their technical focus. Ali’s role, product manager, focuses more on the management of teams and the direction of products. Technical understanding
                            is important, but communication skills are more important for this particular role. Omer’s role as a senior front-end engineer is in very high demand and is a classic skillset in the development world. It is an essential role
                            in bringing many only platforms to life. Troy’s ideal role as a firmware/hardware engineer ventures into the role of actual hardware, which introduces a new dynamic and requires a completely different skillset. Finally, Mohamed’s
                            role as a security analyst requires a keen and devious mind, as well as the technical skills to back it up in order to defend systems against potential adversaries.

                        <p>A product manager is an eclectic role that requires superior organisational and communication skills, and needs to be able to dabble in everything and coordinate with multiple stakeholders. For that reason, the argument can be
                            made that nearly all the generic skills listed can be required. Many of the skills encompass others, for example, communication includes writing and presentation. Looking at this data has not necessarily changed my perception
                            of the position, but it has given me an appreciation of how many skills are involved in being a Product Manager. I have a long way to go and a lot to learn. The path to becoming a product manager is not necessarily linear because
                            there are so many different skills involved, but it is certainly very interesting.</p>

                        <p>What the Data tells me is that this role contains very desirable skills, some of which are rated in the top 20, and all in the Top 100. While there was no listing for AutoCAD specifically, Computer Aided Design does encapsulate
                            this skill. Many of the generic skills listed are in the top 20, such as Multitasking and Communication skills, (rank 20 and 1 respectively) which I also expected. I did suspect the lack of Electronics and Hardware skills are
                            reflected in the fact that this role is Hardware and Software based in an industry where the majority of roles are Software based. My opinion has not changed, this role appeals to me greatly because of its diversity. Having
                            worked in IT for almost 20 years, initially as a Technician, and then working my way up to a Linux/Unix System Administrator, what I enjoyed about my role is the multiple roles I would have to fill. I enjoy learning new skills
                            and working on multiple types of tasks greatly. Having worked in IT, I knew SQL would be very high on the list of desirable skills, being quite well versed in administration of SQL server instances. I am however extremely surprised
                            Visual Basic is still in the Top 100 of desired skills, as this has been superseded by VB.NET. I assume this is due to legacy systems, and from personal experience Firmware is not often written in the “newest and greatest”
                            language of the day. For example ADA, which is a programming language first developed in the late 1970’s is still used in the Military for mission critical devices. After I complete my current studies (Bachelor of Information
                            Technology at RMIT) if my health permits, I would really like to proceed with a Bachelor of Mechatronics. Securing a role such as this, or starting my own similar project, would be the end goal of those studies.

                        <p>The ideal job for me would be working as a security analyst for Hays. The skills required by a security analyst are mainly strong communication skills for purposes of interacting with non-technical and technical investors, risk
                            management and assurance, systems design, standard security operating procedures and auditing. The ability to decipher various cloud platforms such as Azure, Google, AWS etc and understanding the standard framework of security
                            guidelines like ISO 27001, PSPF, ISM, VPDS. It is also essential to have within this role a general technical security operations experience and certifications in one or more CompTIA Security +, CISM, CEH, CISSP or ISO27001.
                            I hope to achieve these skills by first getting the appropriate education needed through RMIT university and then joining an internship program for real life experience. I believe practice makes perfect and that is what I intend
                            to do in order to achieve the end goal. (skills and careers, 2020). The common element found within this sector of IT and other sectors such as front-end development and IT management is the use of soft skills such as strong
                            communication skills between stakeholders, an ability to use logic and reason, strong attention to details, organisational skills. The hard skills that are also elements which are common is knowledge of hardware systems. The
                            main difference between my particular field of choice and others in the group is the responsibilities involved for example as a security analyst it is imperative to know the strengths and weaknesses of IT systems and have a
                            methodical approach to difficult circumstances that deal with safety problems. It is also imperative to understand how hackers work and keep up with the industry in terms of criminal cyber-underworld. The responsibility of
                            a security analyst deals with aspects relating to security and seeks out weaknesses in IT infrastructures.

                                            and validate some of the hypotheses we have. We take this feedback directly from the clients and build it into our product strategy.. and also our plan of improving the platform in general.” “Another way (we
                                            interact with the client) is we have some online portals. Some of the time, where we gather ideas for new features and improvements from our customers. So that’s also how you could interact with a client.. if

                                            technology to solve a problem that is hard to crack otherwise for example what we do is that we are taking a traditional problem. The problem of matching business projects with the right people and instead of
                                            doing this completely traditionally with relying on only human intelligence we basically add technology in the mix to help do it in a more optimised way. Another example could be food delivery for example this
                                            basically is like a traditional service that many restaurants are doing in a traditional fashion but if you add technology in the mix then you can optimise your operations which could lead to happier customers

                        <h2 class='underline'>Machine Learning</h2>
                        <p>Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence. It specifically deals with how programs can learn and make decisions [1]. Generally, a machine learning algorithm has two main components. This consists of the learning algorithm
                            and the data set which the algorithm will use to “train”. This is often called training data. The algorithm analyses the training data and forms a model with which it will then use to make intelligent decisions or predictions.
                            There are many types of machine learning algorithms that utilise different heuristics and mathematical models to analyse the training data. How well the data is organised can also play a part in how well the model is trained.
                            This has broad applications in a plethora of industries. It can be used to create video game and boardgame AIs, predict stock prices, diagnose diseases based on images, or intelligently process footage and identify objects
                            in the footage (cctv, self driving cars, etc), and many other areas. A particularly famous recent example is the computer program AlphaGo developed by DeepMind technologies (acquired by Google) that plays the board game Go
                            [2]. It’s training data consisted of previous professional Go games, and thousands of games between humans and AIs. It went on to defeat some of the best Go players in the world, and in fact changed many well-established strategies
                            of the game. Another application of machine learning has been in the rise of virtual personal assistants such as Google Now, Siri, and Alexa. They use machine learning models in the form of speech recognition to become better
                            at recognising the speech of their users. They also collate your information and previous interactions in order to build better models and results that are tailored to the preferences of their users. Speech recognition is also
                            related to natural language processing (NLP), which is the ability to parse and model natural language. Perhaps one of the most state of the art technologies in NLP is IBM Watson. Watson is a question-answering computer system
                            that can answer questions posed in Natural Language. Watson pulls its data from many resources, including academic journals, media articles, dictionaries, encyclopaedias, etc [3]. Machine learning has the potential to impact
                            every aspect of our lives and every industry. At its core, it is a way for technology to analyse information and make intelligent decisions. Decision making is something we all do, every day. Some sources suggest we potentially
                            make thousands of decisions every day [4]. Machine learning will allow us to process massive volumes of data and take that into consideration when making decisions. These decisions likely won’t replace human decision making
                            altogether, rather, it will augment our decision making and allow us to make strategic decisions at higher levels of abstraction. It is inevitable that there will be jobs made redundant, but the technology will enable us to
                            become more strategic in our workforce and perhaps give rise to new positions that previously did not exist. This will affect all industries - transport, medicine, finance, entertainment, etc, and we will need to adapt our
                            processes. It will allow us to be more efficient in all aspects of our decisions, and this will have a direct impact on the lives of everyone. We all leverage technology in one or another without necessarily understanding what
                            is going on under the hood. It is constantly gathering and analysing data in the background, while we only see the end result. As end user, that result can take the form as the best route from home to work, or a simple Google
                            result. It will also effect the lives of professionals and researchers, augmenting their ability to analyse information and make more impactful decisions. There can also be secondary and tertiary stakeholders. For example,
                            if machine learning can help organisations become more sustainable in their processing and logistics, then this can impact the environment which essentially affects all of us. Machine learning will underpin every aspect of
                            our daily life. We use phones and computers, virtual assistants, search engines, etc. We use technology to gather information. When we are looking for entertainment, we may search for reviews of movies and video games. When
                            we’re hungry, we may search for recipes. When we are sick, we may search our symptoms online to try and find some medical advice. With each generation, technology becomes more and more entrenched into our lives. Previous generations
                            may be reluctant to adopt this paradigm shift, or there may be pushback in regards to privacy concerns, but a generation will grow up completely immersed in this environment and these concerns will dissipate as a reliance on
                            technology becomes the norm. For me personally, as someone who is undertaking studies in technology and pursuing a career in this field, I see machine learning as a huge asset and something that will continue to develop and
                            improve our quality of life. It will allow us to make better decisions day to day both professionally and personally. It will give us better healthcare, better and more efficient access to essential services, better entertainment,
                            better transportation, etc. With further advances in machine learning, we may be able to delegate tasks to machines, allowing us to complete our work quickly and efficiently, thus freeing ourselves to spend more time with the
                            ones we love. It will allow us to spend more time doing the things we enjoy, and perhaps allows us to remain more connected than ever. We are seeing signs of this technology disrupting industries that traditionally did not
                            incorporate technology. It shows us new insights, analyses data in ways we previously thought were not possible, and will ultimately change the way that we approach problems. Machine learning is one of the most important tools
                            currently at our disposal, and we are only scratching the surface of what is possible. I am excited to see what happens and am optimistic of the impact this will have on our lives.

                            <b>What does it do?</b></br> Cybersecurity is definitely a buzzword more than anything, it is the defense process on computers that is used to control and monitor essential and crucial tasks in our everyday lives. ' “Cybersecurity
                            is the protection of information/data, assets, services, and systems of value to reduce the probability of loss, damage/corruption, compromise, or misuse to a level commensurate with the value assigned" ”' (Dan Craigen, Nadia
                            Diakun-Thibault, Randy Purse, Defining Cybersecurity 2014, Table 1). The ‘Cyber Spectrum’ and cybersecurity alone are evolving each year. We can look at large-tech companies like Cybereason, McAfee, Palo Alto Networks, and
                            Checkpoint that not only provide high-end services like viruses, hacking, and *data protection but also they enhance this enormous, competitive, and dangerous industry. Cyber is something that especially in our generation where
                            everybody uses electronic devices, we can be sure that cybersecurity is there. According to Norton Inc. (Symantec), one of the largest Cyber and Anti-Virus companies, there are several different types of cybersecurity:

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Information Security - </b> According to Techpedia.com “Information security (IS) is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer system data from those with malicious intentions.” (What
                            is Information Security (IS)? - Definition from Techopedia, 2012) Or in other words, Information Security is the implementation of defense on data inside small to enterprise-size systems.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Network Security - </b> According to Edureka.co, “Network security is the process of taking preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification,
                            destruction, or improper disclosure.” (Archana Choudary, What is Network Security: An introduction to Network Security 2019, Page 1). In other words, Network Security is a defense on network data and performances within the
                            networking spectrum.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Application Security -</b> Application security is the process of making apps more secure by finding, fixing, and enhancing the security of apps. (David Strom, What is application security? - Definition from CSO.com, 2019)
                            We can understand that Application Security is one of many security levels of a large-protection scheme that intends to protect applications from malware, viruses, and other hacking targets from being stolen and modified for
                            bad usage.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Cloud Security -  </b>According to phoenixNAP.com “Cloud security is a set of control-based safeguards and technology protection designed to protect resources stored online from leakage, theft, or data loss.” (Bojana Dobran,
                            What is Cloud Security & What are the benefits? From phoenixNAP.com, 2018). Cloud Security represents a large factor in almost every organization nowadays that implemented the architecture of technologies that are based on
                            cloud systems. Cloud security goes into various types of strategies formulated to provide more control and protection of data applications inside the cloud.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can understand that Cybersecurity provides a wide range of defense types and services that should be mandatory and a high priority of every company, startup, individuals, and any type of business to be aware and be involved in how to manage their security
                            better. In addition, the question has been asked, can we really perceive how cybersecurity will evolve in 3 years? The answer is definitely yes… This industry is astronomic, competitive, and dependent on innovation. Companies
                            tend to create cutting-edge tools and ideas on almost everything that is related to security and according to statista.com, the cybersecurity market is predicted to grow to 248B U.S dollars by 2023 and not only that by the
                            next three years this sector will focus not only on the cloud applications, network, and systems security but the next ‘hot’ prediction will be AI within cybersecurity.

                        <p>

                            In a nutshell, AI stands for Artificial Intelligence which is the intelligent machines, computers, or any device that can perform and understand tasks like humans without human participation. You are wondering how AI can play a major role in cybersecurity,
                            but ‘surprisingly’ according to Forbes.com ``61% of enterprises say they cannot detect breach attempts today without the use of AI technologies.” Not only that, we can easily give an example of something most of us heard, which
                            is autonomous vehicles like Tesla. Their idea is to create a car that will have its own intelligence and will be able to drive by itself using no help from humans. Imagine what would happen if someone hacks these kinds of vehicles
                            especially that these kinds are intended for self-control. This is where AI in cybersecurity appears. Today, hackers and cyber-researchers are developing systems, methods, and tools using AI to detect early hack breaches like
                            Malware, Ransomware, and data theft which can cause vehicle hacking. Artificial Intelligence helps to manage and learn from smart data collection in real-time how to prevent these attacks.

                        </p>
                        <b>What is the likely impact?</b></br>
                        <p>

                            The potential impact of cybersecurity is massive, it impacts the way we think and the way we use technology. It takes wide awareness and understanding of individuals that cyber is everywhere and people also are known to share information easily on social
                            media, apps, and different kinds of websites, devices, and applications whom their information like passwords, credit card numbers, IDs, and a vast range of sensitive data are been misused wisely which can cause hacking, viruses,
                            and malware attacks. According to Cybintsolutions.com “95% of cybersecurity breaches are due to human error" but we also live in a world that changes quickly. Schools, institutions, information apps, and government sectors
                            are more aware of instructing on how to handle correctly with sensitive data...So which people will be most affected by cybersecurity? The answer is everybody. As mentioned above, this industry applies to everyone that uses
                            technology and tools or its benefits. From the elderly to kids, everybody is exposed to data theft viruses and other cybersecurity threats because of small mistakes and misunderstanding of how to use apps, systems, and websites
                            correctly, and how to be more aware of where you insert your data wisely. In addition to that, companies are most affected by this in terms of time, money, and stability. According to CybintSolutions.com, as long as companies
                            get connected to the internet and innovate by creating more attractive and data-sensitive applications the more competition there will be and as you can guess hackers will be more sophisticated and drawn to make breaches on
                            the sensitive data. Furthermore, competition is not always a bad thing. In this case, we might figure that companies want to hire as many as good Cyber and IT researchers in order to prevent early breaches and make the company
                            ‘unhackable’. The need for early detection of a data breach is a matter of saving companies billions of dollars but not only that but saving their clients and partners data and saving them any secret information that should
                            not be exposed. According to the Harvard Business Review, “The cybersecurity industry will have over 1.5 million vacant positions by 2020. And by 2021, Cybersecurity Ventures predicts this number to go up to 3.5 million”.Not
                            only that, companies will innovate tools and build technology hubs for developing sophisticated strategies of how to enhance cybersecurity and prevent future hacking.


                        </p>
                        <b>How will this affect you?</b></br>
                        <p>
                            The use of technology forces us to be more insightful with how to become more aware of what we do with devices and apps because of risks that can occur in the cyber-spectrum. We as a society are ‘hooked’ and addicted to any electronic device and application
                            we can use, like cellphones, computers, software, and applications. As long as we are drawn to this world we are most likely to be vulnerable to the uncertainty and high danger from people who like to steal data and manipulate
                            it terribly. From my personal insight, I currently work as a front-end developer in a cyber-security company which obligates me to make wiser choices and forehand to build safety strategies every time I work alone or in a team
                            on a company's projects and files. Not only that working in a cyber-company gave me more perception of how this industry works and how it can impact the way we use and think about technology. In addition, this might also affect
                            my friends and family because eventually, we all live in a modern world that uses technology. I usually help my friends and family to understand more about safe browsing and how to use applications correctly before they put
                            any sensitive data into it. I think eventually this world is quite different and unique for me because I grew up before the dot-com ‘bubble’ burst away and it was quite unlike today... I used to be careless about what people
                            can do with computers and data because in my opinion we all were once naive and unaware of what is driving the world and can impact it. can do with computers and data because in my opinion we all were once naive and unaware

                        <b>What does it do?</b></br>
                        <p>

                            Block chain is a chain of blocks that contain data in a secure block. In every block it is difficult to change once data is stored within the block, this is achieved through a few safety procedures put in place. A visual representation of how a single
                            block may look like and its fundamental components are illustrated below[MA1] [MA2] . (What is the purpose of Blockchain Technology?, 2020)
                            <img src="img/table.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <i>The above illustration shows a single block representation , the below illustration shows what each block's components are . The hash, previous hash and data are found within each block of a blockchain. </i>
                            </br>

                        </p>
                        <b>What is hash? </b>
                        <p> It is like a key that unlocks all the data to a block within a blockchain in order to identify the user using a hash. An easy way to see hash is to compare it to fingerprints seeing as fingerprints identify an individual the same
                            way a hash would identify a single block. A hash and fingerprint are both unique. A visual representation of how this may look like is shown below.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            <img src="img/table3.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> When data within a block is tampered with or changed the hash changes with the block and therefore no longer becomes the same block as before. What this allows is for
                            users of that block to know where a change in a block has occurred.
                            </br>
                        </p>

                            <img src="img/table4.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""></br>
                            The third element that makes a blockchain secure is the use of previous hash. As illustrated above each block uses the previous hash. When a block has been tampered or changed it changes the block hash and no longer becomes the same block. Imagine the
                            second block has been tampered with. What this means is that for block three previous hash would change therefore invalidating any blocks proceeding from there onwards. In the case of the first block this block is called the
                            genesis block and starts off the chain.

                            <img src="img/table5.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> Another way blockchain technology secures the data within a block is by using peer to peer networks. Network members can collaborate on the same documentation rather
                            than individual topics; this creates transparency and allows the establishment of innovative numeral interactions. When a network member decides to join a network, he gets a copy of the block and the node can use it to verify
                            everything is still in order. When an individual within the network decides to create a completely new block It is dispersed among network members' blockchain therefore creating consensus as to which block is valid.

                            quicker, more cost effective for users and easier to build more useful applications. Tools such as truffle would also enable the setup of dApps utilising technologies that are known like ReactJS.(2020)

                            The use of cryptocurrency makes it very possible for blockchain technology to store data for the new currency in the years to come. As years have gone by more and more individuals are becoming accustomed to the use of virtual money. This technological
                            development has made virtual money popular and therefore it is possible using cryptocurrency through blockchain technology which is secured data, efficient, cost effective and transparent and decentralised environment could
                            get rid of physical money. The use of cryptocurrency and blockchain makes this controversial topic possible in the future.</p>

                        <p><b>Private transport and ridesharing applications - </b>Blockchain technology can be utilised to create a decentralised peer to peer ride sharing app. This would eliminate third party providers by creating terms and conditions
                            in a secure way between the car owner and user of the car share application.The use of blockchain can also be utilised in medical records, E-notary, collecting taxes, pharmacy, banks. What is likely to change the way everything
                            is utilised in the real-world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>What is the potential impact of this development?</b> Blockchain technology is a device that is revolutionising the way the world works, it is no surprise it is also a very controversial topic. Blockchain facilitates new
                            industrial uses and changes several old systems. It will integrate, highly accessible structures such as mainframes and contemporary public or private clouds. The use of blockchain will change the way we use institutions like
                            law firms, banks, ride sharing devices, store medical records and much more thus making the impact of this development revolutionary. Besides being able to store data within blocks that are secured what can be done now utilising
                            blockchain technology is the use of smart contracts. A smart contract is a simple program that is stored on the block. The way smart contracts work is that it requires order to execute a desired outcome. An example is if an
                            individual decides to lease an apartment, the smart contract could require that person B transfer a desired amount e.g. $200 to person A in exchange for the property door code. This is something that can be done now using blockchain
                            technology.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Which people will be most affected and how?</b> The use of blockchain technology is already disrupting many leading industries for example pharmacy, logistics and more importantly banks. There is an idea that blockchain
                            technology is going to do what the internet did to banking. Blockchain gives access to financial services to individuals or groups all around the globe and this does not exclude third world countries that do not have access
                            to conventional banking. The use of blockchain technology allows individuals to send money immediately with very low fees. Blockchain being a decentralised platform would therefore make the middleman in banks redundant. It
                            acts based on a peer to peer basis and carries out similar procedures to that of a bank without any interference from central directives that supervise all data.
                            <!--to put table number six-->
                            <img src="img/table6.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> Another way blockchain technology secures the data within a block is by using peer to peer networks. Network members can collaborate on the same documentation rather
                            This will essentially create more jobs for those working within the IT sector because of the demand for creativity, innovative ways to contribute to the constantly changing uses of blockchain technology.

                            <p>
                                <b>How does this affect my daily life?</b> The use of blockchain technology affects the daily life of everyone including myself because it eliminates the need to pay a third party service fee because the technology itself
                                can take care of this for you in a more efficient, secure and cheaper way and transactions that generally take several days to go through can be done in almost real time using blockchain technology. This will allow family
                                members or even friends to send and receive money transfers quicker in real-time. It is no surprise as well that many individuals including me have made online purchases using online platforms such as eBay, amazon, Facebook
                                etc. The issue with online transactions is that our knowledge of the seller is limited to what we find in reviews and ratings therefore buyers are mainly expected to place a large amount of trust on the person on the other
                                side to be truthful in their deliverance, or send the right item without trying to cheat the other person. The online transactions generally require the purchaser to send the money before even receiving the products they
                                paid for. The use of blockchain technology deals with these problems through secured methods, found to be efficient, saves money, reduces risk involved because of its transparency, increases trust and most importantly does
                                not require a central authority for it to work. As a student studying IT and persevering towards a career within IT the use of blockchain technology would create jobs within development, project management and engineering
                                sectors thus creating more opportunities for those within IT. The way blockchain technology has changed the way we bank is the factor that will affect members of my family or friends the most as it will change how they
                                carry out transactions from the traditional banking ways to the blockchain module.

                        <h2 class='underline'>Raspberry Pi’s, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices.</h2>
                        <b>What does it do?</b>
                        <p> Raspberry Pi’s, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other similar devices can be categorized as Single-board Computers. While they all share a very similar overarching hardware paradigm, that being small and inexpensive computers on a single
                            PCB board, each of these devices has a distinct purpose and there is very little overlap in their proposed usage. The rise of the Maker segment, along with DIY culture and 3d Printing has helped these distinct devices find
                            new niches to occupy (Orsini, 2020). The popularity of these devices has allowed many people who would normally not be exposed to such technology discover new and interesting ways to utilise them in a multitude of roles. Raspberry
                            Pi is easily the most well-known of the single board computers, and its intended use is very easy to understand, even for those who have no interest or experience in this field. Inspired by the BBC Micro of his childhood, British
                            Engineer Eben Upton designed a modern analogue of this device which had taught tens of thousands of Children to learn programming BASIC in the 1980’s, as part of the UK Government’s Computer Literacy Project (Fromaget, 2020)
                            (History, 2020). His device, called the Raspberry Pi, is a complete computer system you can hold in the palm of your hand and when connected to a keyboard, monitor and network, it functions as a low power Workstation. Raspberry
                            Pi’s run Linux by default and have a dedicated Debian based Linux Operating System distribution which is intended for those who wish to learn Python, a modern High level programming Language (What is Python? Executive Summary,
                            2020). Since 2012 when the first Raspberry Pi Model was released, many revisions with increasing computational power have been released. Some popular uses for them include Print Servers, Video Game Emulators, Media Centres
                            and DNS servers. Arduino is an Open Source Single board computer with an initial focus on electronic prototyping. Arduino can read inputs, for example from an electronic sensor or from software, and turn it into an output,
                            for example, controlling an electric motor, or publishing a Tweet (Arduino - Introduction, 2020). They are programmed using their own programming language “Arduino Programming Language” on a computer using the Arduino IDE .
                            The completed code is uploaded to the board, similar to firmware and then they can perform as a stand-alone unit. This flexibility combined with the low cost of Arduino has led to them being used in almost every facet of DIY
                            and Maker projects (Top Arduino Courses Online - Updated [April 2020], 2020). Many of the projects powered by Arduino are fun, or entertaining, such as a “Solar Powered Automated Lawn Mower” but many are serious projects with
                            serious real-world applications such as “Fingerprint based Locker Systems” (Top 100 Best Arduino Projects List 2020 Topics & Arduino Ideas, 2020). Due to the open source nature of Arduino, in addition to completely assembled
                            kits, some hardware is available for purchase as low-cost kits from multiple manufacturers, which the user has to assemble and solder themselves. This drastically removes the financial barrier to use Arduino based systems in
                            a project. Also many Commercial projects are based on Arduino, such as Flyduino, who make Arduino based Flight controllers and Electronic Speed Controllers designed for Racing and Freestyle Multicopters (Also known as Drones).
                            Makey Makey is a consumer grade inventor kit that lets you turn everyday objects, such as coins, keys, bowls of water, even fruit into input devices using alligator clips. It is aimed at the STEM Youth education sector, and
                            also children who are interested in Electronics and Video games. It is a very simple product, with very simple hardware. The original platform was Arduino based, but after the success of the products Kickstarter, which had
                            over 11,000 backers, they have developed their own hardware (About Us, Learn About Makey Makey's Invention Kits - Makey Makey, 2020). The rise in popularity of these devices is in part due to the low cost of manufacture. While
                            Moore‘s Law pushes the threshold of the leading edge technologies, these lower end devices use chips and components that have not been state of the art for many years, if ever. They leverage the fact that hardware components
                            can be designed smaller over time as new manufacturing technology arises. Additionally, technologies that are not cutting edge often become increasingly cheap to manufacture, as processes develop over years. Many of these devices
                            use older generations of the ARM CPU, which are low power consumption, extremely cheap compared to many of their rivals, and readily available (ARM Processor | History & Features of RISC Architecture, 2020). The future for
                            these devices in a hobby/enthusiast setting is very bright, the online communities formed around these products continue to grow as products from new and existing manufacturers enter the market every year. As an example, on
                            13th of April 2020, the Arduino official Forums had a total of 4,391,854 Posts by 1,004,545 Members, which is roughly equivalent to the population of the city Oslo in Norway (Arduino Forum - Index, 2020). These forums share
                            projects and ideas, and also serve as an entry point for users who wish to get into the hobby . projects and ideas, and also serve as an entry point for users who wish to get into the hobby .

                        <b>What is the likely impact?</b>
                        <p>
                            The impact of such devices entering the consumer enthusiast market cannot be overstated. It places this type of technology into the hands of people who may not have had the opportunity previously, as you no longer need an extensive knowledge of electronics,
                            components and perhaps most daunting of all for new users, there often is no need for soldering. The programming knowledge required is no longer a huge barrier, as STEM education programs use these devices in their curriculum.
                            There are entry points for all programming levels, and if the user desires to pursue their learning further, there are many courses, tutorials and online guides are freely available on the Internet. As these Single Board Computers
                            become more ubiquitous, more initiatives like Raspberry Pi’s “Code Club” will become more prevalent, allowing people to gain knowledge and learn programming and electrical prototyping from a very young age (Education - Training,
                            resources, programmes and events, 2020). There is no doubt that this will lead to more people becoming familiar with such technologies and utilizing them in multiple ways, in both their leisure and professional lives. In the
                            future, if current trends hold true, these Single Board Computers, and devices like them, will become more inexpensive, more prevalent and more accessible to people everywhere. There are multiple Raspberry Pi “clones” or devices
                            that fulfill a similar role to the Raspberry Pi, available that push different ends of the market. For example the very high computational power of the LattePanda, which boasts an i7 x86 based CPU, and a $423AUD price tag,
                            or the Pine A64 which is available for around $20 USD and is marketed as a low cost alternative to the already extremely low cost Raspberry Pi (Heath, 2020). While some of these products may not be suitable as the basis or
                            component of a physical commercial product, they are invaluable learning aids, and extremely useful in prototyping and proof of concepts for developing products inexpensively.


                        </p>
                        <b>How will this affect you?</b>
                        <p>
                            These devices have had a markable impact on my life, in multiple ways. I have had an original Model B Raspberry Pi for many years and even though at present, it is sitting idle in a drawer, it was used as a media centre for a few years, and it worked
                            remarkably well in that role. I gifted my newer Raspberry Pi to my friend’s young nephew, and he has started learning Python and Linux with it. Together we installed Remote Desktop/VNC and I showed him how it works, and he
                            can remote access the Raspberry Pi in his bedroom from school on his laptop or mobile phone. He really enjoys it, and it is very empowering for him to start to understand all these software technologies he thought were extremely
                            intimidating with huge knowledge barriers. Now he wishes to pursue Information Technology as a career and is studying Information Tech in his final year of High School. I believe our time together installing Linux on his Raspberry
                            Pi and configuring it together gave him a small measure of confidence, which he has continued to grow by learning Python online and investigating Linux with my assistance. He has expressed interest in the Pi-hole project, which
                            is a DNS server with Ad blocking for Raspberry Pi (Pi-Hole Project Homepage, 2020). Therefore, I will be able to teach him more about TCP/IP and networking, which will be extremely helpful to him in his future I.T related endeavours.
                            As for Arduino, it is my preferred platform when I build a Racing or Freestyle drone. I use almost exclusively Flight Controllers and Electronic Speed Controllers made by Flyduino. The quality improves with every iteration
                            of the firmware and hardware, and the Arduino ecosystem provides a lot of useful software utilities that Flight Controllers based on other hardware platforms do not have, such as firmware recovery and forcing an update to an
                            unresponsive device, without chip readers or other specific hardware. Single Board Computers have had a remarkable impact on hobbyists, and have become an invaluable tool for professionals. They usually are very low power and
                            inexpensive, but for many projects that is all that is needed. What might be the most important aspect of them is that they often have communities with free software utilities and a large emphasis on learning, and fun.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The project is a mobile application that will allow users to find nearby public bathrooms and bathrooms in shops and restaurants that are open to patrons. The application will list all nearby bathrooms and an overall cleanliness rating. Users will also
                    be able to rate bathrooms they visit and provide feedback. Owners of each bathroom will need to be verified and will be able to provide feedback by replying directly to users or giving bathroom updates such as “recently cleaned”. The
                    application will be available on iOS and Android, as well as having an online portal for users and owners/councils.


                </p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest problems people have when they are out and about is finding a clean toilet. This application addresses several issues. Firstly, it allows users to find clean and hygienic bathrooms when they are out and about or travelling – both locals
                    and tourists. This allows people to complete their business with peace of mind. It provides valuable information for those who are disabled or for mothers with young children. It motivates business owners to keep their establishment
                    clean and creates extra foot traffic to generate business. Business owners can also market deals and special offers through the application to attract users and advertise their business.


                </p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <b> User Application:</b>
                <p>
                    <li><b>Signup:</b> use email, gmail, or facebook. The application requires first name, last name, email, optional mobile number, agreement to T&C</li>
                    <li><b>Login::</b> enter email and password, as well as optional TFA via text message.</li>
                    <li><b>GPS Map:</b> The application will require access to location services and have google maps integration. Based on your current location the application will show all nearby toilets and bathrooms, represented by a small icon.</li>
                    <li><b>Bathroom icons:</b>The icons will show a rating (e.g. 3.5), a business icon, and a glow around the icon to indicate there may be a special offering or deal. You can press the icon above each bathroom to show you additional information
                        including the establishment name, rating out of 5, more details regarding the offer, and opening hours. There will also be an option to “navigate here” which will send the information to google maps for navigation. The icons will
                        also allow you to favourite and share bathrooms via multiple channels (FB, Twitter, Insta, text, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc).</li>
                    <li><b>Feedback:</b> On each icon for a bathroom, you will be able to see the current rating of the bathroom, how many ratings it has, comments from patrons, replies from the owner, and the time it was last cleaned as provided by the owner.
                        There will be an option to provide feedback. The feedback option is initially greyed out and will only allow you to provide feedback if you have recently navigated to the bathroom (within the last hour). This is to prevent people
                        from rating bathrooms without actually going there.</li>
                    <li><b>Offers:</b> Each icon could display an offer or deal by the owner of the shop/restaurant. In order to use the deal, you will need to claim it through the application and provide the verification code at the establishment.</li>
                    <li><b>Profile:</b> Each user will have access to their own profile which tracks metrics such as how many bathrooms they have navigated to, how many they have rated, how many deals they have claimed, and if they have received any replies
                        to their feedback. Users can also view and edit their list of favourite bathrooms. The application also has standard functionality such as updating their details and deleting their account.</li>
                    <li><b>Add bathrooms to map:</b> Users can also add bathrooms to maps which will be added to the application database pending verification.</li>
                </p>
                <b> Owner Application:</b>
                <p>
                    <li><b>Signup/login as Owner:</b> An owner can register and must provide proof of business in order to verify.</li>
                    <li><b>Updates:</b>> Owners will be able to update their opening hours as well provide the last update as to when they last cleaned the bathroom.</li>
                    <li><b>Offers:</b> Owners can provide offers through the app and verify the offer codes of parsons</li>
                    <li><b>Metrics:</b> Owners can track how many people have navigated to their bathroom, how many have provided ratings, how many people have viewed their bathroom, how many people have viewed their offers, and how many people have claimed
                        their offers. They will also be able to view these metrics visually over time which can indicate performance, e,g growth or decline in use.</li>

                <p>
                    The application will be built natively on both iOS and Android. The iOS application will be built using Swift, and the Android application will be built using Java. The application will have a Node.JS backend hosted on AWS. The website front-end will
                    be built using React. The application will require integration with several services such as Facebook, Gmail, Google Maps, and potentially several Point Of Sale systems used by owners in order to track their deals.
                </p>

                <h4>Skills Required</h4>
                <p>
                    This project will require a product manager or project manager to oversee all the different pieces. Initially, a UI/UX designer is needed in order to provide wireframes, user flows, mockups, branding, and usability research amongst businesses and potential
                    users. From there, the project will need a backend developer, a web developer, an Android developer, and an iOS developer. These roles may overlap or require more than one person in a given area depending on the scope and scale of
                    the project. It would potentially need a devops engineer and a QA analyst as well. Required hardware would mostly be iOS and Android devices for testing purposes which are quite easy to come by. All the software skills are mainstream
                    skills and abundant in the industry.
                </p>

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                    The outcome of this project is that users will have a better experience relieving themselves in public restrooms, and businesses generate more foot traffic. The problem is solved by incentivising businesses to clean their restrooms and attract more users
                    by offering deals. The impact is improved hygienic practices in businesses, which can leave lasting impressions on users and motivate them to come back to particular establishments. A secondary benefit is improved health, as cleanliness
                    and hygiene become front of mind when out in public.

                    <b>Omer’s personal reflection:</b>
                    </br> In my opinion, what went well in my group is the collaboration and communication, Everyone was focused and dedicated to the assignment from top to bottom and communicated openly with each other, and shared their ideas and opinions.
                    For me, communication and putting everything on the table are essential for keeping on track of the progress and to fix problems quickly and efficiently. In addition, my team focus is bright and clear, we set objectives, deadlines,
                    and assignments in order to build a work structure to see outcomes and results effectively. We set a clear plan in order to understand what we can achieve and what can be done within assignment deadlines. Also, my team’s organization
                    and consistency for running everything smooth and clean are really on a high standard. I do not think there is something that could be improved within my team, got lucky to have such a wonderful and mindful team. I definitely would
                    like to keep in touch with them in the future but the only thing that could be improved is the communication software that we used, we all used Zoom and WhatApp but we will definitely switch to Team Microsoft because of tracking history
                    purposes and we did not pay for the Zoom premium and we had only 45 min of chats every time and then we had to reset the conversation for the thing I have learned about groups is that groups are definitely a pool of knowledge and skills
                    that everyone contributes to one task and share a vast range of ideas in order to achieve a common goal.
                    </br><b>Troy’s personal reflection: </b> </br>
                    The interview component went very well. I feel we were very fortunate to be able to interview Christos, as he is a very busy individual. He presented very well, and I recognised from my time working in IT that he was very knowledgeable. I enjoyed this
                    component of the Assignment very much. The main thing I feel that could have improved with our group was some of the software used to collaborate and discuss our actions in regard to our Assignment. We did not utilise Microsoft Teams
                    much, if at all. We have discussed this however and moving forward we will be dropping Zoom and favour of utilising Microsoft teams more. We used Google Drive to share the documents while we were working on it, and I found this to
                    work well. In the future I believe we will try and use GitHub more if it is suitable, but as of now, Google Drive worked great. I was surprised how much I enjoyed working with a team again, after a long time away from the IT industry.
                    Myself and the three other active members of the team worked well together, and I enjoyed it greatly. I learned that even though the people are more important than the tools, the tools really help shape the flow of the work. The task
                    was not overly complex, so we could use simple consumer grade tools such as Zoom and Google Drive to accomplish our task, but it got a little more difficult towards the end. We have all talked about this, and in the future, I feel
                    we will have an easier time with more professional tools such as GitHub and Teams.
                    </br> <b>Mohamed’s Personal Reflection:</b> </br>
                    What went well within the group is the interview section of the project with Christos, product manager. I say this because all the necessary questions in the rubric were answered and he gave an elaborate answer on each question. The use of zoom made it
                    easy for the group to collaborate with Christos on one platform. We were fortunate enough to have approximately half an hour session with him and learn from his experience in the industry. We were also easily able to split the workload
                    through WhatsApp and assign each person a question that the interviewer had asked. This way the workload was split fairly, and everyone had access to the interview video through WhatsApp to do their questions in the project. I learned
                    that for groups to be able to work communication would be a key factor. A group without any communication generally results in confusion as to what everyone is supposed to do and confusion leads to idle behaviour within groups. A group
                    must be able to coordinate each individual effort and in order to do that communication is required. One thing that was surprising to see is how well the team collaborated on the group project. We were able to organise ourselves in
                    a manner where no one clashed heads. We found that those individuals who did participate within the group were not half hearted and contributed as much as their team members. It was a great balance and surprise to see that within the
                    working team there was no bickering, no dictatorship, only a group who are working towards a common goal. During the project we found that zoom allows 45minute run time for those that are non-members. I would say that is an aspect
                    we can improve by utilising another platform such as teams or to become members for zoom to collaborate longer rather than having to create a new meeting each time the run-time ends.
                    </br> <b>Ali’s Personal Reflection:</b> </br>
                    It has been a pleasure working with our group. We got off to a slightly slow start, as we didn’t begin the assignment immediately, and we had a few group members come and go. About 2-3 weeks before the assignment was due, we really started to kick things
                    off and communicate a lot more. We all got along quite well, so communication was really easy even though the tools we were using weren’t always the most efficient. For example, we jumped between teams, WhatsApp, Google Docs, github,
                    etc. This made me realise that even though we did not streamline our tool use, the most important aspect of the group was attitude and communication. Tools can’t make us communicate better or make us a better group, they simply enhance
                    what we already have. What we had was great communication which allowed us to do well regardless of tools we were using. Everyone was responsive and made a solid contribution. Everyone’s voice was heard and we made an effort to meet
                    regularly and update the rest of the team if we had roadblocks or challenges. Now that we have a great team dynamic, we can focus on the details like streamlining the tools we use, etc.
                    </br>
                    <h3>Group Reflection:</h3>
                    </b>
                    <b>What went well?</b></br>
                    We feel that everything has gone very well during this group assignment. All the active members of the group “The Notorious Geeks” contributed their work in a timely manner, and of a high standard. If there were any changes or additional work that needed
                    to be done, it was completed, without a single issue and all the active members of the team helped as much as possible. We have developed a strong sense of comradery and we look forward to tackling the next group assignments as a strong
                    team.
                    </br>
                    <b>What could be improved?</b></br>
                    The only real areas we feel we need improvement are the Tools we used to accomplish our task. While we had no serious roadblocks or issues using WhatsApp for keeping in communication, Zoom for daily meetings and Google Docs for collaboration, perhaps
                    the process would have been more streamlined if we used Teams and GitHub more. We have all used Google Docs before, and it worked very well for this project so far. However, we all agree that in the future it might be advantageous
                    to migrate to a different platform. While this is an area we agree we can improve on, we have already internally acknowledged this, and plan to move forward with using enterprise focused tools in the future, such as MS Teams and GitHub,
                    starting with our next assignment. Also, even though we tried to communicate with the inactive members of the group without response, we feel that perhaps with 2 additional active members contributing we could have accomplished a more
                    refined final product. </br>
                    <b>What was surprising?</b> </br>
                    Firstly, our Group dynamic is extremely welcoming, work orientated, and entertaining. It is a very conducive environment for producing great work and pulling together as a team. We have all mentioned we got extremely lucky with the active members of this
                    team, and we all enjoy working together very much. “The Notorious Geeks” very much look forward to tackling the upcoming assignments and testing our collective mettle. The Second surprising thing is how beneficial the interview with
                    our selected I.T. Professional was. Christos was extremely kind to give us some of his valuable time, and it was a pleasure to conduct the interview with someone so articulate and knowledgeable. We all learned a lot from his interview
                    and have collectively recognised that we were very privileged to gain insight from someone as successful in their chosen field (Product Management).</br>
                    <b>What have you learned about Groups? </b> </br>
                    I believe it is safe to say we have all learned how important a positive Group dynamic is for a positive work environment. All of us have talked about how we have been members of teams in the past, either in Work, Sports or Education. Some of these had
                    personality clashes, or problems with members not “doing their share” of the workload. Luckily, we have not had a single issue like this arise in “The Notorious Geeks” and it has helped us reflect on the positives of our Group, and
                    what working in a team should be like. This has just made us stronger, and very positive about what we can accomplish as a team.
